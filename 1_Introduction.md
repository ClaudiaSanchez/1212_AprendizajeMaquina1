# Introduction

Machine Learning definitions:

- [Arthur Samuel](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_L._Samuel) (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- From the book “An Introduction to Statistical Learning”: Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.
- From the book “Machine Learning in action”:
  - Machine learning is turning data into information.
  - Machine learning lies at the intersection of computer science, engineering, and statistics and often appears in other disciplines.
  - It’s a tool that can be applied to many problems. Any field that needs to interpret and act on data can benefit from machine learning techniques.
  - Machine learning uses statistics.
- From the book “Introduction to Machine Learning” of Ethem Alpaydin:
  - Machine learning is not just a database problem; it is also a part of artificial intelligence.
  - Machine learning also helps us find solutions to many problems in vision, speech recognition, and robotics.
  - Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or experience.
