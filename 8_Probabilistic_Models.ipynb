    "Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event (some particular situation occurring) given that another event has occurred. The conditional probability of an event A occurs given the event B is:\n",

    "### Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "Two events are independent, statistically independent, if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent events:\n",
    "- Throw coins, the result of coins is independent of each other.\n",
    "- The probability of rain is independent of passing the math test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent events:\n",
    "- The probability of rain depends on the quantity of clouds.\n",
    "- The hair color depends on age.\n",

    "$ P(A ^ B) = P(A)P(B)$\n",

    "### Bayes' theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n",

    "$ P(A\\B) = \\frac{ P(B\\A)P(A) }{ P(B) }$\n",
