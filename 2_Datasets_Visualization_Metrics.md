# Datasets, Visualization and Metrics

All the Machine Learning algorithms need data. The more the data, the better the learning. The data is required for the learning process of algorithms. A dataset represents all the information that can be processed. For example:
- 1000 images of faces, each one labeled with the person's name.
- Database of the sales department.
- A survey data.

Traditionally, the information is preprocessed to have a table with values, where the columns and rows represent the features and samples, respectively. Feature, also called variable, represents a characteristic of the object. A sample is a concrete object. Some classic nomenclature is:
$𝑁$= Number of Features
$𝑀$= Number of samples
$𝑥_𝑖$= Feature $i$ values ($i$ goes for all the samples)
$𝑥^{(𝑖)}$= Sample $i$ values ($i$ goes for all the features)
$𝑦^{(𝑖)}= Output or label of the sample $i$
$𝑥_𝑗^{(𝑖)}= Sample $i$, feature $j$
